                                                    The film “Venom” tells the amazing story of the appearance of the sworn enemy of the famous and beloved by many people - the spider. But this is not a film about the next confrontation between two people endowed with superpowers. This is a completely different story. Venom is an alien substance that enters our planet in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). It cannot exist and develop independently, a shell is needed that will allow Venom to destroy the Earth. DNA enters the body of journalist Eddie Brock. DNA is capable of destroying everything that is human inside Eddie. A long struggle begins between Man and Universal Evil. In the film there is an internal psychological struggle between an ordinary person and Evil, which can give superpowers, but destroy the personality. How will this struggle end? And why is it almost impossible to resist it? Why did you need another hero who intervenes in this fight?
